# Installation

Install Homeâ˜†Star first. 
See: https://github.com/dpjanes/iotdb-homestar#installation

    $ homestar install homestar-knx

It should be configured. 
This project is based on [KNX.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knx.js), 
so these settings will make more sense in that context

    homestar set "/bridges/KNXBridge/initd/host" '192.168.80.101'
    homestar set "/bridges/KNXBridge/initd/port" 3671
    homestar set "/bridges/KNXBridge/initd/tunnel" "udp://0.0.0.0:13671"

If you don't want to configure it your can pass in "host", "port" and "tunnel" when 
you initialize your Things.
